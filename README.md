# Frontend Mentor - Chat app CSS illustration
## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This project was created as a challenge for my development plan this semester. It was inspired by a project from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), which offers various other cool challenges to work on. Since the goal was to enhance my frontend skills, this challenge only includes HTML, SCSS, and Tailwind, using Angular as the framework.

## Want to run the project locally?
1. You'll need to have Angular, NPM, Node, and Tailwind installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. In the terminal, run the command ng serve or ng s.
